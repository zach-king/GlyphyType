<h1>GlyphyType Tutorial</h1>
<p>So you've started using the GlyphyType application and 
    are ready to start creating your own personalized fonts? 
    Good. Here, you'll find a step-by-step guide to doing just 
    that. </p>

<hr/>

<h2>Step 1: Creating a New Font</h2>
<p>After launching GlyphyType, you should create a new 
    font file. To do this, go to <code>File -> New Font</code> 
    or if you are on Windows/Linux, use <b>Ctrl+N</b>.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Drawing the First Glyph</h2>
<p>Now that you've created a new font, it's time to begin 
    drawing glyphs. In the bottom middle of the application 
    you should notice an exclamation point; this is where you 
    will see which character, symbol, or glyph you are currently 
    drawing. </p>

    <p>To begin drawing your exclamation point glyph, first select 
        a tool to use. A basic exclamation point glyph shape you 
        might make is two rectangles, so select the Rectangle tool 
        either from the Utitlity Toolbar, <code>Tools -> Rectangle</code>,
        or <b>Ctrl+R</b> if you're using Windows/Linux.</p>

        <img src="./config/tutorial_images/rectangle_tool.png" alt="Rectangle Tool Menu" width=400 height=300 />

    <p>To use the Rectangle Tool, simply click and drag in the drawing 
        area. The two corners of the rectangle will be the point you clicked 
        at and the point you released the mouse button at. Play with this tool 
        to familiarize yourself with it.</p>

    <p>When you're done, the exclamation point glyph should look similar to 
        the following:</p>
        <img src="./config/tutorial_images/rectangle.png" alt="Exclamation Mark Glyph" width=400 height=300 />
        

<h2>Step 3: Drawing the Next Glyph</h2>
<p>After completing the exclamation point glyph, you can continue to the 
    next glyph in the glyph map by clicking <b>Next</b> in the 
    Navigation Toolbar. You should notice the current glyph indicator 
    change to a double quotation mark; this is the next glyph to be drawn.</p>

    <p>For this glyph, you might draw two triangles. Let's do this by using the 
        Line Tool. Select the Line Tool either by clicking it in the Utility 
        Toolbar, selecting <code>Tools -> Line</code>, or <b>Ctrl+L</b> if 
        you are using Windows/Linux.</p>
        <img src="./config/tutorial_images/line_tool.png" alt="Line Tool Menu" width=400 height=300 />

    <p>To use the Line Tool, left click with the mouse to create a point. For 
        each consecutive point, you should see your line drawn after clicking. When you 
        have reached the next-to-last point you wish to create, and are ready to close 
        the glyph outline, simply right click with the mouse and a line will automatically 
        be drawn, connecting back to the origin.</p>

    <p>Familiarize yourself with the Line Tool and your double quotation marks might 
        look something like the following:</p>
        <img src="./config/tutorial_images/quotes.png" alt="Double Quotation Glyph" width=400 height=300 />

    <p>Now, continue to the next glyph by clicking <b>Next</b> in the Navigation 
    Toolbar at the bottom of the application. Continue drawing glyphs until you have 
    reached the end of the glyph map. <i>Note: the tilde (~) is the last glyph in the map.</i></p>


<h2>Step 4: Saving the Font</h2>
<p>When creating your font, you definitely do not want to lose your progress, or current 
    state of the font. You can save the font from <code>File -> Save</code> or with 
    <b>Ctrl+S</b> if you are using Windows/Linux.</p>

    <img src="./config/tutorial_images/save.png" alt="Save Font Menu" width=400 height=300 />

    <p>The file that you save will be a <b>.gtfo</b> file (GlyphyType Font Output). This 
    file is not human-readable, and is exclusive to the GlyphyType application.</p>


<h2>Step 5: Exporting the Font to TTF</h2>
<p>Finally, you find yourself ready to actually export a TTF (True Type Font) 
    that you can use! To do this, go to <code>File -> Export Font</code> or 
    <b>Ctrl+Alt+S</b> if you are using Windows/Linux. The TTF file that is exported 
    will have the same name as the GTFO file you are currently working on; thus, 
    you must save your GTFO file prior to exporting.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Importing a Font</h2>
<p>Later you might find that you want to edit your font. This is done by importing 
    the GTFO file. To do this, go to <code>File -> Import Font</code> or <b>Ctrl+O</b> 
    if you are using Windows/Linux. This will open a dialog in which you may select 
    your GTFO file to import.</p>
